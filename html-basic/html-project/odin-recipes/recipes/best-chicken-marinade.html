      <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>

      <br />
      <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
      <p>
        Place chicken in the bowl and turn to coat with marinade. Cover and
        marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 4 hours. For best results, do not
        marinate longer than 4 hours.

      <br />
      <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
      <p>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</p>
      <br />
      <p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
      <p>
        Remove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the
        remaining marinade.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p><strong>Step 6</strong></p>
      <p>
        Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center
        and the juices run clear, 6 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read
        thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F
        (74 degrees C).
